It looks like you're trying to use web support but don't have the required dependencies installed.

Please install react-native-web@~0.18.9, react-dom@18.1.0, @expo/webpack-config@^0.17.2 by running:

npx expo install react-native-web@~0.18.9 react-dom@18.1.0 @expo/webpack-config@^0.17.2

If you're not using web, please ensure you remove the "web" string from the platforms array in the project Expo config.
